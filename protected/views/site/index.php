	and <a href="<?php echo Yii::app()->createUrl('fiction/index'); ?>">speculative fiction author</a>. What brings you to the site?

        Back in my Freshman year of undergrad, I started working for <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/">UIowa</a>'s <a href="http://imu.uiowa.edu/">Iowa Memorial Union</a>.
        Great place &ndash; but being a student office they sent me off into the world after graduation, and I landed at UI's department of Human Resources, Finance &amp; Operations,
        working in <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/hr/imfo/index.html">Information Management</a>.
        Since then I've relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've done a lot of good work with <a href="http://www.prolificgiving.com/">Prolific Giving, Inc.</a>,
        helping communities make their world a better place by making the charitable giving process more efficient and more engaging. I'm currently seeking a new full-time position.

<p>
        Hard science fiction. Mythic fantasy. If it falls in the spectrum, odds are I'll dabble in it. I've been published all over, from <a href="http://www.asimovs.com/">Asmiov's</a>
        to <a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/">Clarkesworld</a> to <a href="http://www.fantasy-magazine.com/">Fantasy Magazine</a>,
        I've been reprinted in the Year's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy (2011 edition), and I attended the <a href="http://www.clarionwest.org/">Clarion West Writers Workshop</a>
        in the summer of 2008.
</p>

<p>
        On July 1, 2012, I joined the fiction editing team at <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/">Strange Horizons</a>. Strange Horizons is a wonderful and venerable magazine
        which has hosted some of my favorite stories, and I'm honored to be a part of it.

<p>
        I've recently made the jump to the San Francisco Bay Area, where I remain amazed at the relative uniformity of day-to-day forecasts. Prior to that I lived in the wilds of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_City,_Iowa">Eastern Iowa</a>, with several pets, several roommates, and a degree in Linguistics.
        I weave <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_(armour)">chain maille</a>, laugh often at <a href="http://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a>, and highly recommend the novel
        <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zBBshCdGbVwC">Season of Migration to the North</a></em> as well as the young-adult novel
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rustle-Grass-Robin-Hawdon/dp/0396085229"><em>A Rustle In The Grass</em></a> and the short-story collection
        <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=omon4g5U_PcC&amp;printsec=frontcover">4 By Pelevin</a></em>.</p>
